Industrial powered prosthetics to this data still rely on finite state machines, have unrealistic cost requirements and are generally inaccessible to the average parapalegic, with around 70% of amputees never receiving a prosthetic. 

This project aims to collect open-source EMG, kinematic, and kinetic data, merge into a homogenous indexable format for foundational model training.
